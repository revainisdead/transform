dt = delta time
speed = pixels
fps = frames per second

3 speed * 60 fps = 180 pixels per second

To go 180 p/s (pixels per second)
How much do I move per dt?

distance = dt * x

x = distance / time
{{{ Velocity. }}}

time = 1 ; distance = 180

180 p/s = v = d/dt

180 * dt = d

# Actually move with d (distance)
rect.x + d

Normalize (for diagonal speed)
x, y = math.sqroot(x**2 + y**2)
